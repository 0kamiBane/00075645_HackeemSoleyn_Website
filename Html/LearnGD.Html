            <h2>What Is Game Development?</h2>
            <p>Game development is the process of creating video games by combining creativity and technology. It involves planning ideas, designing gameplay, creating visual and audio assets, writing code, and testing the final product. Game development is not handled by a single person but usually involves a team of designers, programmers, artists, and testers working together to create an interactive experience.</p>

        <section class="LearningpageS2_Stages">
            <h2>Stages of Game Development</h2>
            
            <div class="Learning_StageContainer">
                <div class="Learning_StageBlock">
                    <h3>Planning & Design</h3>
                    <p>During the planning and design stage, developers decide what the game will be about and how it will work. This includes creating characters, defining game rules, designing levels, and planning how players will interact with the game. A strong design phase helps reduce problems later in development.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="Learning_StageBlock">
                    <h3>Development & Production</h3>
                    <p>In the development stage, ideas are turned into a playable game. Developers use game engines, programming languages, and creative tools to build the game's systems, visuals, and sound. This stage often takes the longest and involves continuous testing and improvement.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="Learning_StageBlock">
                    <h3>Testing & Release</h3>
                    <p>Before release, games are tested to find bugs, performance issues, and gameplay problems. Testing ensures the game is enjoyable and stable. Once testing is complete, the game is prepared for release on platforms such as PC, consoles, or mobile devices.</p>

        <section class="LearningpageS3_GameEngine">
            <h2>What Is a Game Engine?</h2>
            <p>A game engine is software that provides tools to create and run video games. It handles tasks such as rendering graphics, managing physics, processing input, and controlling game logic. Game engines allow developers to focus on gameplay and design instead of building everything from scratch.</p>

        <section class="LearningpageS4_Roles">
            <h2>Who Makes Games?</h2>
            <p>Game development is usually a team effort. Common roles include:</p>
            <ul class="Learning_RoleList">
                <li><strong>Game Designers</strong> -  plan gameplay mechanics and player experience</li>
                <li><strong>Programmers</strong> -  write code that makes the game function</li>
                <li><strong>Artists</strong> -  create characters, environments, and animations</li>
                <li><strong>Sound Designers</strong> -  produce music and sound effects</li>
                <li><strong>Testers</strong> -  find bugs and ensure quality</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="LearningpageS5_WhyLearn">
            <h2>Why Learn Game Development?</h2>
            <p>Learning game development helps build problemsolving, creativity, and logical thinking skills. It introduces concepts from programming, design, and digital media that are useful beyond games. Even at a basic level, understanding how games are made allows players and creators to appreciate the work involved in interactive entertainment.</p>
