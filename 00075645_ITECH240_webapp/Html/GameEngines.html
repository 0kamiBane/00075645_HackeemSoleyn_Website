          <h2>What Is a Game Engine?</h2>
          <p>A game engine is software that provides the core tools needed to create and run a video game. It manages important systems such as graphics rendering, physics, input handling, and game logic. By using a game engine, developers can focus on designing gameplay and content instead of building technical systems from scratch.</p>
          
      </section>

      <section class="EnginespageS2_Importance">
          <h2>Why Do Developers Use Game Engines?</h2>
          <p>Game engines simplify the development process and make game creation more efficient. They allow developers to prototype ideas quickly, test gameplay mechanics, and deploy games to multiple platforms. Engines also provide built in tools that support collaboration between programmers, artists, and designers.</p>
